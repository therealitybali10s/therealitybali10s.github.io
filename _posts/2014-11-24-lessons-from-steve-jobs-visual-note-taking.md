When I heard <a href="http://twitter.com/guykawasaki" target="_blank">@guykawasaki</a>, former Chief Apple evangelist, was coming to town I knew I had to see him. He taught some familiar lessons he learnt while working for Steve Jobs in the '80s.

Here are some of the visual notes I took.

You should also check out <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/22543-the-art-of-the-start-2-0" target="_blank">Guy's new book</a>. I've owned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Start-Time-Tested-Battle-Hardened-Starting-ebook/dp/B000QJLQY4" target="_blank">the first version</a> since 2008. To this day it's still one of the most valuable business book I've read.
