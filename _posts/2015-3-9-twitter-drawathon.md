This month I'm launching a book that will teach you how to capture, clarify and communicate information and ideas using pictures. It's called *Everybody Draw Now* (yes, inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12VUjgYMm1U" target="_blank">â€™90s hit song</a>).

To get yourself in a drawing mood leading up to the book launch you can take part in the Twitter draw-a-thon.

## Here's how it works.

1. Every **week day** for the rest of March there will be a different picture to draw.
2. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/blairrorani" target="_blank">@blairrorani</a> on Twitter and look for the <a href="#drawing-of-the-day">drawing of the day</a> tweet at 9:00 am Sydney time.
3. Draw your picture and tweet it with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/everybodydrawnow" target="_blank">#everybodydrawnow</a> and the day, e.g. **\#day1**.

It's not a competition and there are no wrong answers or test scores. Just a bit of fun and some good drawing practice!

I'll post a <a href="/drawathon-day-1">video of me drawing</a> my picture each day. Plus if you go all out and tweet **all 15 pics** you'll get a special surprise at the end.

Want to get better at drawing? Do the Twitter draw-a-thon and unleash your *inner drawer* today.
